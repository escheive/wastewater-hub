        "Sedimentation tanks/Clarifiers: These tanks settle solids using gravity. It is important for the wastewater to spend enough time in these tanks for gravity to fully accomplish sedimentation. Typical detention time of ~ 2 hours.",
        "Aeration tanks: Microorganisms consume organic matter in the wastewater. It is important for the microorganisms to have enough time to consume an appropriate amount of bio matter. It is also important to have a detention time long enough so that you aren't washing out your microorganisms too fast. Typical detention time is ~ 4-8 hours.",

Wastewater systems are designed to handle a maximum amount of loading so knowing the daily load can help ensure the system doesn't become overloaded. Sudden changes in loading can indicate illegal discharges or equipment failures. The loading data for a plant can be used to adjust:",
